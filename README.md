# {PROJECT S.A.M.I.R}
{PROJECTâ€¯S.A.M.I.R} began as a rescue mission â€” salvaging parts from an old family PC destined for recycling. Rebuilt into a compact, highâ€‘performance rig, it became my first true lab platform and the foundation for everything that followed
# âš¡ Project S.A.M.I.R v1 â€” Resurrection Build

## âš¡ First Boot in Nearly a Decade

When I first pressed the power button on this machine, it hadnâ€™t been switched on in around six years.  
The old Cooler Master case still held the ASUS Maximusâ€¯VII Gene, Intel Core i7â€‘4790, dual Palit GTXâ€¯970s in SLI, and a semiâ€‘modular Corsair CS750M PSU â€” all exactly as theyâ€™d been left.

Dust had settled into every vent, the thermal paste was long past its prime, and the BIOS battery had likely been dead for years.  
But on the first try, it POSTed â€” a moment that turned forgotten parts into the foundation of my first serious lab build.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Build Matters

This wasnâ€™t just a PC upgrade â€” it was a resurrection.  
Bringing a system back from nearâ€‘junk status taught me:

- How to assess and safely revive longâ€‘stored hardware  
- The importance of cleaning, reâ€‘pasting, and testing before upgrades  
- How to blend salvage and new parts into a cohesive, reliable system  

This build became **Project S.A.M.I.R v1** â€” the launchpad for my current multiâ€‘VM lab and the beginning of my journey into systems architecture and cybersecurity.

# {PROJECT S.A.M.I.R}
{PROJECT S.A.M.I.R} began as a rescue mission — salvaging parts from an old family PC destined for recycling. Rebuilt into a compact, high‑performance rig, it became my first true lab platform and the foundation for everything that followed
# ⚡ Project S.A.M.I.R v1 — Resurrection Build

# ⚡ First Boot — Before It Truly Powered On  

When I first pressed the power button, this system hadn’t been switched on in nearly six years.  
Inside the old Cooler Master case, I found an **ASUS Maximus VII Gene motherboard**, an **Intel Core i7-4790**, dual **Palit GTX 970s in SLI**, and a **Corsair CS750M PSU** — all exactly as they had been left.  

It didn’t power on.  
At first, I thought it was nothing more than outdated junk, destined for the recycling pile. But curiosity drove me to investigate further.

## ♻ Salvaged Components  

- **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Maximus VII Gene (Z97, mATX)  
- **CPU:** Intel Core i7-4790 @ 3.6 GHz  
- **CPU Cooler:** Cooler Master Hyper H412R  
- **GPU:** 2× Palit GTX 970 4 GB (SLI)  
- **PSU:** Corsair CS750M — 750 W, 80+ Gold, semi-modular  
- **Cables:** Original SATA and power leads  

The system was covered in dust, the thermal paste had long dried out, and the BIOS battery was likely dead.  
This was my first time handling a PC build at this level — and I knew I had a lot to learn.

## 🔍 First Steps  

Since a new PC wasn’t within budget, I turned this challenge into an opportunity to learn.  
I reached out to family with PC-building experience and managed to salvage this unused system that was originally destined for recycling.  

At first, I thought it lacked a CPU, but after opening the case I discovered the full setup was still intact.  
That moment was the spark — I began researching each component, watching tutorials, and documenting every step.

## 🛠️ Disassembly & Cleaning  

One evening, I fully disassembled the PC.  
I carefully removed each part, catalogued the components using PCPartPicker, and cleaned years of accumulated dust.  

This process taught me hardware identification, compatibility checks, and safe handling of delicate components — skills I had never practiced before but are directly relevant to troubleshooting and maintaining systems.

## 🆕 New Parts for the Revival  

To bring the system back to life, I invested in a few upgrades:  

- **RAM:** 32 GB DDR3 (4×8 GB HyperX Fury sticks)  
- **SSD:** 2× Corsair 2.5" 1 TB drives  
- **HDD:** 2 TB Seagate Barracuda  
- **Case:** Phanteks G400A — improved airflow, modern design, and cable management  

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways  

- **Problem-Solving:** Identified issues and researched solutions with limited resources.  
- **Hands-On Learning:** Gained first experience with PC hardware disassembly, cleaning, and compatibility checks.  
- **Resourcefulness:** Re-purposed salvaged components into a working system instead of discarding them.  
- **Foundational Knowledge:** Built practical skills that complement my ongoing *CompTIA Security+* studies — especially in understanding hardware security risks and system resilience.

👉 This project is the foundation of my technical portfolio.  
It demonstrates curiosity, persistence, and the ability to learn quickly — qualities I plan to build on as I continue my journey into IT and cybersecurity.  


## 🎯 Why This Build Matters

This wasn’t just a PC upgrade — it was a resurrection.  
Bringing a system back from near‑junk status taught me:

- How to assess and safely revive long‑stored hardware  
- The importance of cleaning, re‑pasting, and testing before upgrades  
- How to blend salvage and new parts into a cohesive, reliable system  

This build became **Project S.A.M.I.R v1** — the launchpad for my current multi‑VM lab and the beginning of my journey into systems architecture and cybersecurity.

## 🔍 First Steps  

Since a new PC wasn’t within budget, I turned this challenge into an opportunity to learn.  
I reached out to family with PC-building experience and managed to salvage this unused system that was originally destined for recycling.  

At first, I thought it lacked a CPU, but after opening the case I discovered the full setup was still intact.  
That moment was the spark — I began researching each component, watching tutorials, and documenting every step.

## ⚡ First Boot — Before It Truly Powered On  

When I first pressed the power button, this system hadn’t been switched on in nearly six years.  
Inside the old Cooler Master case, I found an **ASUS Maximus VII Gene motherboard**, an **Intel Core i7-4790**, dual **Palit GTX 970s in SLI**, and a **Corsair CS750M PSU** — all exactly as they had been left.  

It didn’t power on.  
At first, I thought it was nothing more than outdated junk, destined for the recycling pile. But curiosity drove me to investigate further.

## ♻ Salvaged Components  

- **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Maximus VII Gene (Z97, mATX)  
- **CPU:** Intel Core i7-4790 @ 3.6 GHz  
- **CPU Cooler:** Cooler Master Hyper H412R  
- **GPU:** 2× Palit GTX 970 4 GB (SLI)  
- **PSU:** Corsair CS750M — 750 W, 80+ Gold, semi-modular  
- **Cables:** Original SATA and power leads  

The system was covered in dust, the thermal paste had long dried out, and the BIOS battery was likely dead.  
This was my first time handling a PC build at this level — and I knew I had a lot to learn.

## 🛠️ Disassembly & Cleaning  

One evening, I fully disassembled the PC.  
I carefully removed each part, catalogued the components using PCPartPicker, and cleaned years of accumulated dust.  

This process taught me hardware identification, compatibility checks, and safe handling of delicate components — skills I had never practiced before but are directly relevant to troubleshooting and maintaining systems.

## 🆕 New Parts for the Revival  

Once I had the core system cleaned and identified, I knew it still needed a few upgrades to actually run as a modern, usable machine.  

- **RAM:** I maxed out the motherboard’s capacity with 32 GB of DDR3 (4×8 GB HyperX Fury sticks). This gave me the headroom to run heavier workloads and experiment with virtual machines later on.  
- **Storage:** With 8 SATA ports available, I wanted to make full use of the platform. I installed 2× Corsair 1 TB SSDs and a 2 TB Seagate Barracuda HDD — giving me 6 TB of storage out of the box, with room to expand further.  
- **Boot & OS:** I picked up a SanDisk 128 GB USB 3.0 stick to create a Windows 10 Pro installer. A fresh CR2032 BIOS battery was also installed to replace the dead one.  
- **Case:** Finally, I moved everything into a new Phanteks G400A — a case known for airflow, tempered glass, and cable management.  

This balanced approach kept costs low while transforming the salvaged system into a reliable foundation for learning and experimentation.

## 💡 Key Takeaways  

- **Problem-Solving:** Identified issues and researched solutions with limited resources.  
- **Hands-On Learning:** Gained first experience with PC hardware disassembly, cleaning, and compatibility checks.  
- **Resourcefulness:** Re-purposed salvaged components into a working system instead of discarding them.  
- **Foundational Knowledge:** Built practical skills that complement my ongoing *CompTIA Security+* studies — especially in understanding hardware security risks and system resilience.

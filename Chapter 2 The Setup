# 🖥️ Project S.A.M.I.R — Chapter 2: The Setup  

If Chapter 1 was about reviving the system, Chapter 2 is about giving it a home. A dedicated workspace transforms the project from just a PC build into a true platform for learning, practice, and growth.

## 🪑 The Workspace  

I wanted this project to be personal — not a forgotten tower under a desk, but something I could connect with every day. That meant creating a dedicated, organized environment:  

- **Desk:** Large enough to handle dual monitors and allow room for peripherals and notes.  
- **Monitor Mounts:** Adjustable dual-arm mounts for ergonomics and flexibility.  
- **Layout:** Clean and functional, set up to make long study or lab sessions productive.

## 🖥️ Displays & Peripherals  

- **Monitors:** [Add your sizes/resolutions here] — chosen for multitasking, running labs, and monitoring side by side.  
- **Keyboard & Mouse:** Reliable and comfortable for long sessions.  
- **Headset/Speakers:** For training, labs, and focus during study.

## 🌐 Purpose of the Setup  

This isn’t just aesthetics — it’s about building the right environment for hands-on learning:  

- Running VMs for testing and practice  
- Monitoring systems in real time (tying into the “Monitoring” in S.A.M.I.R)  
- Preparing for *CompTIA Security+* with a lab I control  
- Building discipline with a workspace that feels professional

## 🚀 What’s Next  

- Expanding into virtualization (VMware, VirtualBox, or Proxmox)  
- Adding networking gear (switch, router, firewall) for deeper security testing  
- Documenting lab exercises as future chapters

👉 With Chapter 2, Project S.A.M.I.R isn’t just revived hardware — it’s my personal workspace, the place where my cybersecurity journey truly happens.
